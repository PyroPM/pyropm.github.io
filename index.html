              <p>
                We first met at High-Performance Computing Club, a club at Liberty University that Sarah was the president of at the time. Sean was just attending as a member, both interested in the high-performance computers that the club had.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were both nerds... (and at least one of us still is...)

              <h1>News of a Japan Trip</h1>
              <p>
                In the fall of 2022, Dr. Tuzi advertized a trip through LU Send and the School of Engineering to Japan, visiting some of the world's biggest supercomputers and tour the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both of us were interested, and it gave us course credit alongside an amazing trip to a country we wanted to visit one day, so we both signed up not knowing what God had in store for us...

              <h1>Preparations</h1>
              <p>
                Leading up to the trip, we were put in the High Performance Computing course that went alongside the trip. On top of that, we had weekly meetings to study basic Japanese to prepare for it.
              </p>
              <p>
                We learned a bit of the language we probably didn't need to know... but those meetings were quite helpful in making us ready for the trip. Plus we got to spend a lot of time together...

              <h1>The Land of the Rising Sun</h1>
              <p>
                Spring Break came, and that meant an early wake up call and a drive to Richmond for our flight. Unknown to us at the time, but we were set to sit next to each other for essentially all of the flights... we watched some anime on the way over.

              <p>
                Throughout the trip, we spent a lot of time with each other in a group of 4... and eventually we got paired up for a full day out in Kamakura with three Japanese girls that we just followed around for the day. Gave us a lot of time to get to know each other...
